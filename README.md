## Spring + React Project
Hi, folks! <p>During the event of the "Dev Superior" course, we built a tracking system a project for tracking sales in a company. The frontend was developed using TypeScript, HTML and CSS. The backend was developed using Java Spring Boot.</p>
<p>This is the frontend that was developed:</p>

<div align="center">

</div>

<p>The objective of this view is to keep track of the sales of each employee. If the salesperson performs well, you can click on the red icon and a notification will be sent to the employee's cell phone. To send the message, an API was created to fetch the information from the database and send the message congratulating the seller and with other information. To store the information, the H2 database was used, which is a relational database written in Java. Below we have 2 images, the left image shows the login console with H2 and the right image shows the DBMS of the database. At this point I was checking to see if the data was entered correctly. . </p>

</div>


<p>Currently, there is still no integration between the backend and the frontend. The next step is integration and running the application in the cloud. </p>
